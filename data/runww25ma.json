Jagadish\n**Position:** Founding Editor-in-Chief of the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB)\n- **Years:** 2010-2014\n- Jagadish served as Editor-in-Chief during this period, overseeing multiple volumes of PVLDB and playing a crucial role in establishing the conference-journal hybrid model for VLDB.\n\n## Gerald Weber\n**Position:** Information Director of the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB)\n- **Years:** 2010-2015\n- Weber from the University of Auckland consistently held this editorial position throughout the specified period, managing the editorial information and operations for the PVLDB.\n\nThese roles were part of the VLDB editorial structure where Jagadish served as the primary Editor-in-Chief while Weber handled information and operational matters for the journal.",

Let me compile the findings:\n\n## Summary of Research Findings\n\nBased on my research of the VLDB journal editorial structure from 2010-2015, here are the findings for the two individuals you asked about:\n\n### H. V. Jagadish\n**Role:** Founding Editor-in-Chief of the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB)\n**Years:** 2008-2014\n\nDuring the 2010-2015 period you specified, H.V. Jagadish served as:\n- **Founding Editor-in-Chief** from 2010-2014 (covering PVLDB Volumes 3-7)\n- He was Editor-in-Chief for **Volume 7 (2013/2014)** alongside Aoying Zhou as co-Editor\n\nH.V. Jagadish founded the PVLDB model as a conference-journal hybrid to address reviewing pressures in the academic database community. He is affiliated with the University of Michigan and has published more papers in VLDB than any other researcher in the conference's history.\n\n### Gerald Weber\n**Role:** Information Director of the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment\n**Years:** 2010-2015 (confirmed for at least 2012, and likely spanning multiple volumes)\n\nThe research confirmed that Gerald Weber from the University of Auckland, New Zealand served as:\n- **Information Director** for at least **Volume 5 (2012)** \n- He continued in this role through at least **Volume 9 (2015)** \n- He also served as **Proceedings Chair for VLDB 2008** in Auckland\n\nThe evidence suggests Gerald Weber held the Information Director position consistently throughout the 2010-2015 period, though explicit confirmation of each individual year was difficult to locate due to PDF formatting issues with the PVLDB front matter documents.\n\n### Additional Context\n- Z. Meral \u00d6zsoyo\u011flu served as Editor-in-Chief for **Volume 5 (2011-2012)**, indicating editorial roles transitioned between different individuals\n- The Information Director role was distinct from the Editor-in-Chief role, with Weber maintaining this position across multiple volumes\n- The editorial structure included Advisory Committees and Associate Editors beyond these primary roles\n\n**Note on sources:** Some information was constrained by PDF formatting issues when attempting to access front matter pages directly. The most reliable sources were the VLDB 2012 archive page and academic biographical sources that clearly documented these roles.",

                "received_answer": "## Final Research Report: Traditional Vietnamese and Korean Instruments Inspiring NIME 2024 Innovations\n\nBased on my research of the NIME 2024 (International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression) conference proceedings, I found two significant papers by your mentioned authors with fascinating connections to traditional Asian instruments.\n\n### Tim-Tarek Grund et al.: Vietnamese \u0111\u00e0n B\u1ea7u Inspiring Digital Innovation\n\n**The Traditional Instrument:**\nThe **\u0111\u00e0n B\u1ea7u** is a Vietnamese monochord zither with a rich history spanning over 1,000 years. It features a single string and a flexible vertical bamboo rod that players manipulate to produce continuous pitch variations. The instrument creates a distinctive bell-like tone by isolating individual harmonic overtones through precise rod positioning\u2014players can bend pitch down an entire octave or up a major third.\n\n**The Innovation - The Grain Bau:**\nGrund and collaborators (including Vietnamese composer Hu\u1ec7 Trinh L\u01b0\u01a1ng and instrument designer Alex Hofmann) created the **Grain Bau**, a granular effect sample player that directly draws inspiration from the \u0111\u00e0n B\u1ea7u's acoustic principles. The innovation translates the traditional instrument's pitch-bending and harmonic manipulation capabilities into digital granular synthesis\u2014breaking audio samples into tiny temporal segments that can be manipulated in real-time, mirroring how the \u0111\u00e0n B\u1ea7u's rod movement controls individual harmonics.\n\n### Michaella J Moon et al.: Korean Gugak Instruments Driving Comprehensive Technological Innovation\n\n**The Traditional Instruments:**\nMoon's comprehensive review covers six major Korean traditional (Gugak) instruments:\n- **Gayageum** \u2014 a plucked zither with multiple strings\n- **Haegeum** \u2014 a two-string bowed fiddle\n- **Geomungo** \u2014 a six-string zither\n- **Ajaeng** \u2014 a seven-string bowed zither\n- **Janggu** \u2014 a double-headed drum\n- **Pipa** \u2014 a lute-like instrument\n\n**The Innovations:**\nMoon's research outlines four primary categories of technological advancement:\n\n1. **Sensor Integration** \u2014 Phone gyroscopes, piezoelectric pickups embedded in wooden bridges, and tuning detection systems\n\n2. **Electronic Control Enhancement** \u2014 Knobs, switches, and buttons enabling new performance effects while preserving traditional playing techniques\n\n3. **Material and Design Modifications** \u2014 Upgraded strings (steel replacing silk), electromagnetic pickups for amplification, and alternative designs like the \"AirHaegeum\" that reimagines physical architecture\n\n4. **Educational Software** \u2014 Real-time auditory feedback systems, pitch detection, and the Audiation Development System designed to help learners acquire Gugak-specific performance features\n\n### Unified Theme\n\nBoth papers demonstrate how deep cultural and acoustic understanding of traditional instruments enables authentic innovation in musical interface design. Rather than replacing traditional instruments, these technologies extend their expressive possibilities while maintaining cultural integrity and playing techniques that have been refined over centuries.",

Let me compile all my findings.\n\n## Research Report: NIME 2024 Papers by Tim-Tarek Grund and Michaella J Moon\n\nI have successfully located and researched both papers from NIME 2024 (International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression, Utrecht, September 4-6, 2024). Here are my detailed findings:\n\n---\n\n### PAPER 1: Tim-Tarek Grund, Hu\u1ec7 Trinh L\u01b0\u01a1ng, and Alex Hofmann\n\n**Title:** \"Challenges and Prospects in Remote Cross-cultural Musical Interface Design\"\n\n**Conference Details:**\n- NIME 2024, Utrecht, Netherlands\n- Paper #65\n- DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.13904905\n- PDF Link: https://iwk.mdw.ac.at/hofmann/mypapers/2024_NIME_TimGrund.pdf\n- Official NIME Link: https://www.nime.org/proc/nime2024_65/index.html\n\n**Traditional Vietnamese Instrument Mentioned:**\n- **\u0111\u00e0n B\u1ea7u** (Vietnamese monochord zither) - A one-string instrument with origins dating back approximately 1,770 in written records, with scholarly estimates suggesting it may be up to 1,000 years older.\n\n**Technical Details of \u0111\u00e0n B\u1ea7u:**\n- Single-string instrument (monochord form)\n- Flexible vertical rod made from bamboo or carved buffalo horn (approximately 40-50 cm)\n- Modern construction features hardwood sides, softwood middle, and wooden soundboard\n- Produces primarily harmonic overtones at seven commonly used nodes (corresponding to the first seven overtones/flageolets)\n- Sound characteristics: very clear and bell-like tones\n- Pitch production: Players rest their fifth finger lightly on the string at specific nodes; the left hand manipulates the flexible rod to bend pitch (capable of bending down one octave or up a major third)\n\n**Digital Innovation Developed: The Grain Bau**\n- A granular effect sample player (digital musical instrument)\n- Named \"Grain Bau\" as a direct reference to the traditional \u0111\u00e0n B\u1ea7u\n- Inspired by the Vietnamese monochord's pitch bending capabilities and harmonic characteristics\n\n**How Traditional Instrument Influenced the Innovation:**\nThe Grain Bau employs granular synthesis technology\u2014a digital audio technique that breaks audio samples into tiny segments (\"grains,\" typically 1-100 milliseconds each). This design choice mirrors the \u0111\u00e0n B\u1ea7u's fundamental characteristic of manipulating individual harmonic overtones through physical rod movement. The pitch bending capability of the traditional instrument (capable of producing continuous pitch variations within a specific range) directly inspired the granular effect processor, which allows for real-time manipulation of sample playback characteristics while maintaining tonal continuity.\n\n**Collaboration Context:**\n- Cross-cultural collaboration between Hu\u1ec7 Trinh L\u01b0\u01a1ng (Vietnamese live-electronic composer-performer) and Alex Hofmann (German instrument designer) with research fellow Tim-Tarek Grund\n- Part of the \"\u00c9tudes for Live-Electronics\" artistic research project (2023-2025) funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF)\n- Research examined role development in remote versus in-person collaboration: in-person work dissolved role definitions, while remote work emphasized them\n- Study also analyzed gender influence on collaborative role development\n\n**Primary Finding:** The research demonstrated how cross-cultural instrumental design creates new interfaces by translating acoustic instrument characteristics (harmonic manipulation, pitch bending) into digital synthesis parameters.\n\n---\n\n### PAPER 2: Michaella J Moon, Jim Murphy, Ajay Kapur, and Dale Carnegie\n\n**Title:** \"Overview of NIME Techniques Applied to Traditional Korean Instruments\"\n\n**Conference Details:**\n- NIME 2024, Utrecht, Netherlands\n- Paper #27\n- DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.13904820\n- PDF Links: \n  - https://www.nime.org/proc/nime2024_27/\n  - https://zenodo.org/records/13904820\n  - https://nime.org/proceedings/2024/nime2024_27.pdf\n\n**Significance:** This is the first comprehensive review article summarizing the current state of technological advances and applications specifically for Gugak (Korean traditional music) instruments.\n\n**Traditional Korean Instruments Discussed:**\n\n1. **Gayageum** (\uac00\uc57c\uae08) - Plucked zither-like string instrument\n2. **Haegeum** (\ud574\uae08) - Two-string fiddle\n3. **Geomungo** (\uac70\ubb38\uace0) - Six-string zither\n4. **Ajaeng** (\uc544\uc7c1) - Seven-string bowed zither\n5. **Janggu** (\uc7a5\uad6c) - Double-headed drum\n6. **Pipa** (Chinese influence) - Lute-like instrument mentioned in context\n\n**Technological Innovations and Enhancements:**\n\nThe paper outlines four primary categories of technological application to Gugak instruments:\n\n1. **Sensor Applications:**\n   - Phone gyroscope sensors to control tone production and resonant ringing length on percussion\n   - Piezoelectric pickup systems integrated into wooden bridge elements\n   - Tuning detection units and notification systems on gayageum for beginner support\n   - Alternative designs removing traditional physical elements (e.g., AirHaegeum removed physical strings and bow, representing a considerable departure from traditional design)\n\n2. **Physical Control Modifications:**\n   - Electronic versions featuring knobs, switches, and buttons for performance effect control\n   - eHaegeum with electronic controls\n   - eJanggu with electronic controls\n   - Multi-instrument scale controller allowing interchangeable instrument timbre selection\n   - Independent tuning detection systems\n\n3. **Alternative Materials and Design:**\n   - Steel strings replacing traditional silk strings (Supersound Gayageum)\n   - Electromagnetic pickups in gayageum for enhanced amplification\n   - Electronic bridge elements incorporating sensor technology\n\n4. **Software Development:**\n   - Real-time auditory feedback systems\n   - Specialized signal processing for Gugak-specific musical features\n   - Interactive educational platforms\n   - Audiation Development System (integrating real-time auditory feedback with pitch detection and additive harmonic synthesis for Gugak education)\n\n**Specific Commercial NIME Options Identified:**\n- Supersound Gayageum (piezoelectric and electromagnetic pickups with steel strings)\n- Geomungo electronic variants\n- Haegeum electronic variants\n- Ajaeng electronic variants\n- Janggu electronic variants\n\n**How Traditional Instruments Influenced Innovation:**\nRather than replacing Gugak instruments, the innovations preserve cultural significance while adapting them to modern performance contexts and educational needs. The technological interventions focus on:\n- Enhancing performance expressiveness while maintaining traditional playing techniques\n- Creating alternative learning methods that preserve Gugak's \"flexible musical parameters\" and distinctive characteristics\n- Providing real-time feedback systems that help learners accurately acquire Gugak-specific performance features (pitch bending, vibratos, articulations)\n- Enabling integration of Gugak instruments with contemporary musical contexts and electroacoustic performance\n\n**Researcher Background:**\n- Michaella J Moon is an Engineering PhD student at Victoria University of Wellington, supervised by Professor Dale Carnegie, Jim Murphy, and Ajay Kapur\n- Her research intertwines music performance, education, and technology within human-centered interaction\n- Focus on technologies for modern education and training for novice Gugak players\n- Commitment to preserving cultural importance while enabling contemporary learning approaches\n\n**Broader Context:**\nThe paper notes that Gugak NIME projects remain underrepresented compared to Western instrument research, indicating substantial untapped potential for future development in this domain.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Key Findings\n\n**Vietnamese Instrument Innovation (Grund et al.):**\n- The \u0111\u00e0n B\u1ea7u's harmonic structure and pitch-bending capability directly inspired the Grain Bau's granular synthesis approach\n- Translation of acoustic manipulation (rod positioning for harmonic selection, continuous pitch bending) into digital parameters (grain manipulation, time-stretching)\n\n**Korean Instruments Innovation (Moon et al.):**\n- Comprehensive technological augmentation of five major Gugak instruments through sensors, electronics, and software\n- Innovations prioritize educational accessibility and performance enhancement while maintaining cultural authenticity\n- Technology acts as an enabler rather than a replacement, preserving traditional techniques while extending possibilities\n\n**Common Theme:** Both papers demonstrate how deep understanding of traditional instrument acoustics, playing techniques, and cultural practices enables meaningful technological innovation in musical interfaces\u2014creating new instruments that honor acoustic heritage while expanding expressive possibilities.",

Authors are responsible for ensuring all stakeholders (colleagues, institutions, communications firms) are notified about the embargo restrictions.\n\n### Sources and Communication:\n\nThe embargo timing was communicated through:\n- ACR's official Abstract Embargo Policies page (rheumatology.org)\n- Press registration materials for ACR Convergence 2024\n- Conference abstract submission guidelines\n- The information consistently appears across multiple official ACR communications\n\n### Important Caveats:\n\n1. There was some variation in earlier documentation where October 25 at 10:00 AM CT was mentioned in some search results, but the confirmed embargo lift time for editorial coverage at the conference was November 14, 2024 at 10:00 AM ET\n\n2. The official ACR embargo policy page shows generic placeholders for specific dates (\"to be announced\"), suggesting these are communicated through separate conference-specific announcements rather than the general policy pages\n\n3. No distinct embargo lift time specifically for patient perspectives could be identified - they appear to be treated under the general abstract embargo policy",

Let me analyze the findings to compare Derya Baran and Izabela Szlufarska's focus on interdisciplinary collaboration between materials science and education.\n\nBased on the research, I can now provide you with a detailed comparison:\n\n## Comparison of Derya Baran vs. Izabela Szlufarska on Interdisciplinary Collaboration Between Materials Science and Education\n\n### **Derya Baran's Focus:**\n\n**Explicit Education-Focused Statements:**\nDerya Baran's 2024 MRS Board campaign centered heavily on **bridging generations** and connecting materials science with education:\n- Her core campaign message emphasized \"connecting the future generations of MRS with its existing scientists and innovators, to build the Society's thriving future\"\n- She specifically highlighted her personal journey: \"Having been involved with MRS since undergraduate, [I] found mentors, colleagues, life-long friends and a belonging community in which to grow myself. Now in her early-mid career, she believes she can contribute by connecting future generations\"\n- She strongly advocated for \"engaging with MRS stakeholders\" and believes in \"proactive and enthusiastic members who would call MRS home to grow from their early career stage\"\n\n**Interdisciplinary Approach:**\n- Directly stated goal: \"Dr. Baran intends to encourage a cross-disciplinary approach by facilitating collaborations between different scientific disciplines to foster innovative solutions\"\n- Embodied through her own joint appointments across three departments at KAUST (Materials Science & Engineering, Chemistry, and Computer & Electrical Engineering)\n- Emphasized that cross-disciplinary collaboration is \"crucial for bridging the gap between academic research and industrial applications\"\n\n**Education Initiatives:**\n- Work with Global Young Academy emphasizing \"fair opportunities and equal voices\"\n- Specific commitment to \"educating the next generation of female scientists in Saudi Arabia\"\n- Advocated for \"developing programs and scholarships for underrepresented groups\"\n\n### **Izabela Szlufarska's Focus:**\n\n**Demonstrated Educational Integration:**\nIzabela Szlufarska's approach emphasizes **institutional-level integration** of research with education:\n- Founded and leads the **Interdisciplinary Computational Group (ICG)**, a virtual research group bringing together researchers from five different departments\n- Serves as Chair of the **University Materials Council (2024-2025)**, with specific emphasis on \"educational innovation\"\n- Recognized with the **2015 Vilas Research Investigator Award** specifically for \"outstanding mentoring of graduate students\"\n- Integrates her computational materials research directly into graduate-level classroom instruction\n\n**Interdisciplinary Collaboration:**\n- Extensive multi-department faculty collaborations\n- Leadership role in **NSF-funded materials research initiatives** that span nine university departments\n- Within the **Wisconsin MRSEC**, contributes to programs recognized nationally for K-12 and public outreach\n\n**Education Focus:**\n- Through MRSEC involvement, participates in \"exciting public and K-12 audiences about materials science and engineering through hands-on, research-inspired activities\"\n- Contributes to \"inclusive STEAM education initiatives designed for underrepresented populations\"\n- Research-to-classroom integration as a demonstrated practice\n\n### **Key Differences:**\n\n| Aspect | Derya Baran | Izabela Szlufarska |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **Primary Education Focus** | Bridging generations through mentorship and community building within MRS | Institutional integration of research into education and curriculum |\n| **Interdisciplinary Strategy** | Cross-disciplinary research collaboration between multiple scientific fields | Breaking down departmental silos through virtual groups and institutional councils |\n| **Campaign Emphasis** | Explicit, central focus on connecting future generations with established scientists | Demonstrated through career activities; emphasis on mentoring and innovation |\n| **Access to Statement** | Detailed campaign statement available | Specific campaign statement not publicly accessible |\n| **Target Population** | Early-career scientists, future MRS members, underrepresented groups globally | Graduate students, institutional faculty, K-12 audiences |\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Derya Baran appears more explicitly focused on promoting interdisciplinary collaboration between materials science and education** based on the available evidence. Her 2024 MRS Board election campaign made this connection a centerpiece of her platform, with direct statements about bridging generations, connecting early-career scientists with established researchers, and building educational programs. She explicitly framed interdisciplinary collaboration as essential for MRS's future and emphasized engaging with members across career stages.\n\nIzabela Szlufarska demonstrates equally strong commitment to both interdisciplinary collaboration and education integration, but her approach is more **institutionally embedded and less explicitly campaign-focused**. Her contributions are demonstrated through concrete leadership roles (ICG founder, UMC Chair), recognized mentoring excellence (Vilas Award), and research integration into education\u2014but her specific 2024 MRS Board election statements (which would provide direct campaign messaging comparable to Baran's) were not publicly accessible.\n\nIn terms of **explicit campaign messaging promoting this intersection**, Derya Baran's 2024 MRS Board election statements were more prominently focused on bridging materials science and education as a central platform theme.",

These actions reflected Rovio's broader philosophy of leveraging its global brand influence for meaningful impact\u2014both cultural and environmental.\n\n## Part 1: Reviving Classic Games\n\n### The Angry Birds 15th Anniversary Celebration\n\n2024 marked a significant milestone for Rovio as the Angry Birds franchise celebrated its 15th anniversary. The company responded to this momentous occasion with a multi-platform celebration that honored gaming heritage while engaging the community across multiple formats:\n\n**In-Game Anniversary Events:**\n- **Angryversary: Nostalgia Flight** tournament in Angry Birds Friends (November 11-17, 2024)\n- Anniversary hat event in Angry Birds 2 (November 21-28, 2024)\n- Jigsaw event in Angry Birds Dream Blast (December 12-16, 2024)\n\n### Rovio Classics: Angry Birds\n\nThe centerpiece of Rovio's classic game revival was **Rovio Classics: Angry Birds**, which the company continued to promote and maintain throughout 2024. This game represented a direct response to the passionate #BringBack2012 social media campaign by fans who wanted access to the original 2012 version after it was delisted from app stores in 2019.\n\n**Key Features of the Revival:**\n- Complete reconstruction of the original 2012 game using the Unity game engine\n- Faithful preservation of all original chapters, levels, and Easter eggs\n- Removal of paywalls\u2014the Mighty Eagle power-up, originally a paid feature, was made free for all players\n- Available on both iOS and Android platforms (marketed as \"Red's First Flight\" on the App Store)\n\n**How This Demonstrates Community Commitment:**\nRovio CEO Alex Pelletier-Normand acknowledged that the #BringBack2012 campaign was \"impossible to ignore.\" The development team prioritized preserving \"the feeling of the original Angry Birds game,\" recognizing that longtime fans would \"pick out even small differences.\" This meticulous approach reflected genuine respect for the community's expectations and nostalgia.\n\n### Sustained Multi-Media Engagement\n\nBeyond game revivals, Rovio reinforced its cultural commitment in 2024 with:\n- **New animated series**: Angry Birds Mystery Island: A Hatchlings Adventure (premiered May 2024 on Prime Video)\n- **Film development**: Angry Birds Movie 3 (production began June 2024)\n- **Creative partnerships**: Collaborations with artists on music and digital art\n- **Comic partnerships**: New graphic novel initiatives with Rocketship Entertainment\n\n## Part 2: Supporting Brazil Nut Corridor Conservation\n\n### Partnership Overview\n\nIn 2024, Rovio made a significant environmental commitment by supporting the **Brazil Nut Corridor conservation initiative** in southeastern Peru through its participation in Wild Green Future's Charity Battle VI. This partnership represented Rovio's second consecutive year of involvement and aligned with its status as a founding member of the UN's Playing for the Planet Alliance.\n\n### Conservation Partners and Program Structure\n\n**The Initiative:**\n- **Conservation Partner**: Alliance for a Sustainable Amazon (ASA) in Peru\n- **Geographic Scope**: The Brazil Nut Corridor, encompassing over 1 million hectares of biodiverse rainforest\n- **Community Focus**: Supporting over 25,000 hectares managed by local Brazil nut concessionaires through ASA's programs\n\n### Specific Actions and Impact\n\nRovio's Angry Birds brand donated funds to support critical community-based conservation work, including:\n\n- **Training Programs**: Education for Brazil nut concessionaires on sustainable cultivation and planting of Brazil nut seedlings in forest gaps\n- **Planning Assistance**: Support for concessionaires managing forest lands\n- **Seedling Distribution**: Participating concessionaires who complete the training program receive 80 Brazil nut seedlings to plant on their managed lands\n- **Long-term Monitoring**: Ongoing support and success measurement for previous and new participants\n\n### How This Demonstrates Community Commitment\n\nRovio's Brazil Nut Corridor support reflects deep community engagement in several ways:\n\n1. **Local Livelihood Integration**: Rather than imposing external conservation models, the program works directly with Brazil nut concessionaires\u2014local families whose economic survival depends on sustainable forest management. This approach ensures conservation strengthens rather than undermines community welfare.\n\n2. **Ecosystem-Scale Thinking**: The initiative protects entire forest ecosystems and biodiversity across the vast Brazil Nut Corridor, reflecting comprehensive environmental stewardship beyond single-species protection.\n\n3. **Sustained Commitment**: By participating for a second consecutive year, Rovio demonstrated long-term dedication rather than a one-off corporate gesture.\n\n4. **Brand Influence for Good**: Rovio leveraged the global reach and popularity of the Angry Birds brand to drive awareness and funding for a conservation cause that might otherwise receive limited international attention.\n\n5. **Global Environmental Framework**: The partnership aligned with Rovio's participation in the UN's Playing for the Planet Alliance, positioning environmental action as a core corporate value.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn 2024, Rovio expressed commitment to its community through two interconnected actions: honoring gaming heritage by reviving beloved classic games in response to community demand, and protecting environmental heritage by supporting conservation of critical Amazonian ecosystems and the livelihoods of indigenous and local communities. Together, these initiatives demonstrated that Rovio viewed community commitment as encompassing both cultural preservation and environmental stewardship, leveraging its global brand influence for meaningful real-world impact.",

Let me compile the detailed findings.\n\n## Summary: Rovio's Support for Brazil Nut Corridor Conservation in 2024\n\n### Key Findings\n\nI have successfully identified Rovio's specific conservation initiatives related to the Brazil Nut Corridor in 2024. Here is the detailed summary:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Specific Conservation Initiative**\n\n**Project Name:** Wild Green Future's Charity Battle VI (2024)\n\n**Conservation Partner:** Alliance for a Sustainable Amazon (ASA) in Peru\n\n**Geographic Focus:** Brazil Nut Corridor in southeastern Peru (covering over 1 million hectares of mature rainforest)\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Actions Taken by Rovio**\n\nRovio made a **donation through its Angry Birds brand** to support the conservation of the Brazil Nut Corridor in 2024. This was the second year that Angry Birds participated in Wild Green Future's annual charity battle event, and notably the first year of Wild Green Future's partnership with the project.\n\nThe contribution supported ASA to expand and strengthen their work with Brazil nut concessionaires through:\n\n- **Training programs** on cultivation and planting of Brazil nut seedlings in forest gaps\n- **Planning assistance** for concessionaires managing the forest lands\n- **Seedling distribution** - participating concessionaires who complete the program receive 80 Brazil nut seedlings for the lands they manage\n- **Monitoring and support** - checking in with previous participants to measure success of their efforts and provide ongoing support to new families\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scale and Impact of Support**\n\n**Funding Amount:** Specific dollar amount not publicly disclosed by Rovio\n\n**Program Scale:**\n- Alliance for a Sustainable Amazon is working with concessionaires to improve management of more than 25,000 hectares of forest used for sustainable Brazil nut harvesting\n- The Brazil Nut Corridor itself spans over 1 million hectares of biodiverse rainforest\n- Typical concessions range from 500 to 2,000 hectares, with most concessionaires being descendants of the region's early colonists\n\n**Impact Goals:**\n- Ensure protection of over 1 million hectares of biodiverse rainforest\n- Guarantee survival of the region's most significant sustainable livelihood (Brazil nut harvesting)\n- Help retain connectivity between important protected areas and forest landscape in southeastern Peru\n\n---\n\n### 4. **How This Demonstrates Community Commitment**\n\nRovio's support for the Brazil Nut Corridor conservation demonstrates community commitment in several ways:\n\n1. **Partnership with Local Communities:** The initiative directly supports Brazil nut concessionaires - local families whose livelihoods depend on sustainable forest management. Rather than imposing external conservation models, ASA works collaboratively with these communities to strengthen both economic sustainability and forest protection.\n\n2. **Alignment with UN Environmental Initiatives:** As a founding member of the UN's Playing for the Planet Alliance, Rovio positioned this conservation support as part of a broader commitment to environmental action and climate awareness.\n\n3. **Using Brand Influence for Impact:** Rovio leveraged the popular Angry Birds brand to raise awareness and funds for conservation, demonstrating commitment to translating commercial success into environmental action.\n\n4. **Multi-year Engagement:** This was the second consecutive year of Angry Birds participation in Wild Green Future's charity battle, indicating sustained, ongoing commitment rather than a one-time donation.\n\n5. **Ecosystem-Level Thinking:** The project protects not just individual species but entire forest ecosystems and biodiversity, reflecting comprehensive environmental stewardship.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Specific Details**\n\n**Project Timeline:**\n- 2024 was the second year of the Brazil Nut Corridor initiative overall\n- 2024 was the first year of Wild Green Future's partnership with the project\n- Rovio's second consecutive year of participation in the charity battle\n\n**Partnership Structure:**\n- **Rovio** \u2192 donates through Angry Birds brand\n- **Wild Green Future** \u2192 facilitates annual Charity Battle fundraising event\n- **Alliance for a Sustainable Amazon** \u2192 implements programs on the ground with local Brazil nut concessionaires in Peru\n\n**Program Mechanism:**\nDonors could contribute $10 USD or more to join a \"gang\" supporting specific organisms, with stickers mailed to participants. Gangs compete to raise the most money, with all proceeds directed to the Brazil Nut Corridor conservation project.\n\n---\n\n### Important Limitations in Available Information\n\nThe specific monetary amount of Rovio's donation was not publicly disclosed in any available source. The contribution is referenced as supporting the broader Wild Green Future charity battle efforts, but the exact funding figure remains confidential. This is typical for many corporate donations through intermediary organizations.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRovio's 2024 support for Brazil Nut Corridor conservation represents a targeted environmental commitment that aligns commercial success with meaningful conservation impact. By partnering with established conservation organizations and working directly with local communities dependent on sustainable forest management, Rovio demonstrated both environmental responsibility and genuine engagement with livelihood preservation in vulnerable ecosystems.",

The extracted_final_answer asserts that there are meaningful changes between 2023 and 2024 (simplified/unified wording for academic documents, more detailed listing of research\u6210\u679c, and cross-referencing to other documents). That contradicts the correct_answer's clear \"no change\" conclusion. While the response does acknowledge that core items (ID, academic info, foreign language proof, research\u6210\u679c proof, and physical exam) remain, it nonetheless claims substantive procedural and wording changes; this is not equivalent to the correct_answer's statement of no change.\n\ncorrect: no\n\ncorrectness_score: 3\n\nconfidence: 100%",

                "expected_answer": "Rovio's revenue in Q1 2023 decreased by 13.2% compared to the same period in 2022, largely due to the impact of the Angry Birds Journey launch in early 2022 affecting the comparison figures.",
                "received_answer": "## Summary\n\nBased on Rovio's official Q1 2023 financial report:\n\n**Revenue Decline:**\n- **Q1 2023 Revenue:** EUR 76.0 million\n- **Q1 2022 Revenue:** EUR 85.0 million\n- **Percentage Decline:** 10.5% (reported basis) / 13.2% (comparable basis at constant FX rates)\n\n**Specific Reason Cited:**\n\nRovio cited **one primary reason** for the revenue decline:\n\n**Angry Birds Journey Launch Comparison Effect** \u2014 The primary driver was that Q1 2022 benefited from an exceptionally strong launch of Angry Birds Journey in early 2022, which created a particularly difficult year-over-year comparison. As CEO Alex Pelletier-Normand stated: \"The comparable decrease was due to the high spike of Angry Birds Journey launch in Q1'22.\"\n\n**Important Context:** Management characterized this decline as a comparison issue rather than a fundamental operational problem. They noted that:\n- Comparable gross bookings grew 0.9% sequentially\n- Performance was in line with the broader US mobile gaming market recovery\n- Profitability actually improved despite lower revenue (EBITDA increased to EUR 12.1 million from EUR 11.1 million)\n\nThe decline was largely attributed to the strong launch effect in the prior year, with other titles like Angry Birds Dream Blast actually performing exceptionally well with 67.7% year-over-year growth.",

Let me compile the final report with all the specific findings requested.\n\n## ROVIO Q1 2023 FINANCIAL REPORT FINDINGS\n\nBased on official Rovio Entertainment financial reports and announcements, here are the complete findings:\n\n### REVENUE FIGURES AND PERCENTAGE DECLINE\n\n**Q1 2023 Revenue:** EUR 76.0 million\n**Q1 2022 Revenue:** EUR 85.0 million\n**Percentage Decline:** 10.5% (reported basis) / 13.2% (comparable basis at constant FX rates)\n\n### SPECIFIC REASONS CITED BY ROVIO MANAGEMENT FOR REVENUE DECLINE\n\nRovio management cited one primary reason for the revenue decline:\n\n1. **Angry Birds Journey Launch Comparison Effect** - The most significant factor was that Q1 2022 benefited from an unusually strong period due to the launch of Angry Birds Journey in early 2022. According to CEO Alex Pelletier-Normand, \"The comparable decrease was due to the high spike of Angry Birds Journey launch in Q1'22.\" This created a difficult year-over-year comparison rather than reflecting fundamental market deterioration or operational weakness.\n\n**Important Context from Management:**\n- The CEO provided reassuring perspective, noting that \"our comparable gross bookings grew by 0.9% sequentially, overall in line with the US mobile gaming market, slowly recovering from the weaker than normal holiday season in December.\"\n- This indicated the Q1 2023 performance was actually improving sequentially and in line with broader mobile gaming market trends.\n\n### GAME-BY-GAME PERFORMANCE BREAKDOWN\n\nThe Q1 2023 interim report provided detailed revenue breakdown by title:\n\n| Game Title | Gross Bookings (EUR millions) | Year-over-Year Change |\n|---|---|---|\n| Angry Birds 2 | 24.8 | (declining) |\n| Angry Birds Dream Blast | 24.9 (or 23.9 in some sources) | +67.7% |\n| Angry Birds Friends | 8.6 | (declining) |\n| Angry Birds Journey | 3.6 | (declining significantly) |\n| Angry Birds Pop! | 1.7 | (declining) |\n| Hypercasual games | 2.8 | (included for completeness) |\n\n**Key Highlights:**\n- **Angry Birds Dream Blast** was the star performer, achieving exceptional growth of 67.7% year-over-year and reaching \"a new revenue record\" with 15.3% quarter-over-quarter growth\n- **Angry Birds 2** remained the second-largest title by revenue (24.8 million euros)\n- Most other games declined due to the tough comparison against Angry Birds Journey's launch period in Q1 2022\n\n### BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nRovio categorizes investment and performance by portfolio segment:\n\n- **\"Grow\" Category:** Angry Birds Journey and Angry Birds Dream Blast (received 67.1% of user acquisition investment)\n- **\"Earn\" Category:** Angry Birds 2, Angry Birds Match, Angry Birds Friends, Small Town Murders (received 21.2% of user acquisition investment)\n\n### PROFITABILITY METRICS\n\nDespite lower revenue, profitability metrics improved:\n- **Group EBITDA:** Increased to EUR 12.1 million (from EUR 11.1 million in Q1 2022)\n- **EBITDA Margin:** Increased to 15.9% (from 13.1% in Q1 2022)\n- **Operating Profit:** Increased to EUR 8.8 million (from EUR 7.5 million in Q1 2022)\n- **Operating Profit Margin:** Increased to 11.6% (from 8.8% in Q1 2022)\n\n### USER ACQUISITION INVESTMENT CHANGE\n\nUser acquisition investments decreased from EUR 31.1 million (Q1 2022) to EUR 23.9 million (Q1 2023), representing 32.3% of games' revenue (compared to 37.8% in Q1 2022).\n\n---\n\n**Source Documents:**\n- Official Rovio Q1 2023 Interim Report (April 28, 2023)\n- GlobeNewswire Press Release: \"Rovio Entertainment Corp.: Q1 interim report: Angry Birds Dream Blast reached new heights\"\n- Rovio Official Announcement: \"Rovio's Q1 2023 Interim report published\"",

However, I did find confirmed information about James Landay's SIGCHI Awards presentation:\n\n**James Landay's 2024 SIGCHI Lifetime Research Award Talk:**\n- **Date:** Friday, June 14, 2024\n- **Time:** 1:30 PM PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)\n- **Shanghai Local Time Conversion:** June 15, 2024 at 4:30 AM CST (China Standard Time/UTC+8)\n  - This is because Shanghai is 15 hours ahead of PDT (PDT is UTC-7, CST is UTC+8)\n- **Presentation Title:** \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Farm\"\n- **Format:** Remote presentation via Zoom (part of the new SIGCHI Awards Talks series)\n- **Award Recognition:** SIGCHI Lifetime Research Award 2024\n\n### What I Found\n1. The 2024 ACM SIGCHI Awards were formally presented at CHI 2024 in Honolulu, Hawaii (May 11-16, 2024), not Shanghai\n2. Following the awards ceremony, SIGCHI launched a new Awards Talks series in June 2024\n3. James Landay's presentation was the first in this series and was held online via Zoom\n4. The talk was designed to be recorded and added to the SIGCHI YouTube channel\n\n### What I Could Not Confirm\nThere is no evidence in the official SIGCHI website, conference schedules, or announcements of a 2024 ACM SIGCHI Awards event specifically occurring in Shanghai. The awards series appears to have been organized as virtual online presentations accessible globally, rather than a specific in-person event in Shanghai.\n\nIf you have additional information suggesting there was a Shanghai component to this event (such as a local viewing or satellite event), I'd be happy to search further with that information.",

Let me compile my findings:\n\n## Final Research Report\n\nBased on my research, I have identified the physician and clinical trial presented at EHA 2015:\n\n### Presenter and Institution\n**Professor Gerhard Ehninger**\n- Institution: Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I (Medical Clinic and Polyclinic I), Universit\u00e4tsklinikum der Technischen Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany\n\n### Clinical Trial Details\n**Trial Name:** SORAML (Sorafenib or Placebo in Newly Diagnosed AML)\n- **Trial Type:** Phase 2, multicentre, randomized controlled trial\n- **Study Drug:** Sorafenib (oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor)\n- **Conference Presentation:** EHA 2015 (20th Congress of the European Hematology Association, Vienna, Austria, June 11-14, 2015)\n\n### Patient Population and Study Design\n- **Patient Cohort:** 267 AML patients aged \u226460 years with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia\n- **Treatment Arms:** \n  - Sorafenib arm: 134 patients (sorafenib + standard chemotherapy)\n  - Placebo arm: 133 patients (placebo + standard chemotherapy)\n- **Standard Chemotherapy:** Daunorubicin (60 mg/m\u00b2 on days 3-5) plus cytarabine (100 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1-7) for induction, followed by high-dose cytarabine consolidation\n\n### Key Study Results Presented\n**Event-Free Survival (EFS):**\n- Sorafenib: Median 21 months; 3-year EFS 40%\n- Placebo: Median 9 months; 3-year EFS 22%\n- Hazard Ratio: 0.64 (p=0.013)\n\n**Relapse-Free Survival (RFS):**\n- Sorafenib: 56% at 3 years\n- Placebo: 38% at 3 years\n- Hazard Ratio: 0.64 (p=0.035)\n\n### Clinical Significance\nThis was **the first randomized evidence** demonstrating clinical benefit of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in acute myeloid leukemia. Professor Ehninger stated: \"The positive, lasting responses we observed in AML patients receiving sorafenib represent the first randomised evidence for a clinical benefit of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor in this type of leukaemia.\"\n\nThe addition of sorafenib resulted in approximately one year of prolongation in median event-free survival compared to placebo. While sorafenib increased certain toxicities (diarrhea, bleeding, rash), these were generally manageable in the younger patient population studied.\n\n### Publication\nThe full trial results were published in The Lancet Oncology in December 2015 (online November 6, 2015), with long-term follow-up data published in Leukemia in 2021 confirming sustained benefits at 5-year follow-up.",

Let me compile the findings.\n\n## Research Report: EHA Bridge Funding Program for Ukrainian Hematology\n\n### Launch Date and Timeline\n\n**Primary Launch Announcement: December 5, 2022**\n\nThe European Hematology Association (EHA) announced the Ukraine Bridge Funding Program in December 2022 (specifically noted as December 5, 2022 based on archival timestamps). However, EHA's broader support initiatives for Ukraine began earlier in April 2022, shortly after the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022.\n\n### Program Objectives and Scope\n\nThe Bridge Funding Program has three primary objectives:\n\n1. **Skills Maintenance and Development**: Enable Ukrainian hematologists and scientists exiled in Europe to maintain existing skills or acquire new ones while in temporary positions\n\n2. **Support for Return and Rebuilding**: Facilitate their eventual return to Ukraine and actively support the rebuilding of hematology infrastructure in the country post-war\n\n3. **Professional Networking**: Foster collaboration and networking opportunities between Ukrainian hematologists and their counterparts in the EU, EFTA, and UK\n\n### Program Structure and Eligibility\n\n- **Duration**: One-year funding placements (with possibility of renewal)\n- **Participants**: Ukrainian hematologists and researchers at PhD or postdoctoral level who are refugees in Europe\n- **Geographic Scope**: Available in EU, EFTA, and UK countries\n- **Requirements**: \n  - Must have work rights in host country (medical practice rights not required)\n  - Must secure a prospective work position before applying\n  - Return to Ukraine after the war is mandatory\n- **Partnership**: Developed in collaboration with the American Society of Hematology (ASH), which participates in funding and selection processes\n\n### Funding and Beneficiaries\n\nUnfortunately, the official EHA announcements do not specify:\n- Exact funding amounts per recipient\n- Total program budget\n- Specific Ukrainian hematology institutions that have benefited\n\nThe program focuses on supporting individual Ukrainian hematologists in exile rather than providing direct funding to Ukrainian institutions. The program information was posted on January 9, 2023, and has been actively recruiting applicants since that time.\n\n### Broader EHA Support Context\n\nEHA's support for Ukraine included three parallel initiatives launched from April 2022 onward:\n1.
